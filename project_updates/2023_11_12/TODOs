some future TODO ideas:
- caching on memory:
    Use a dictionary to keep track of responses from your database given an "action" and its "inputs". For example, user_cached[("search_summoner", "Taran")] = [User(Taran, id, ...),...]
- seeding/migrating database:
    serializing your data and output into JSON or some binary file,
    then reading it to reseed your database from scratch
- responsive website:
    looks good on phone, tablet, or desktop
- Clean the Look:
    nicer background color, font, contrast, homepage/about page, header, footer, spacing
- use redirects:
    to link accounts and matches between each other - clicking on a user allows you to check their last matches
    and players they played with.
- create gif showing how the website works
