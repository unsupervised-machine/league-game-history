## League of Legends Match History

### Description

This project is currently in development and aims to collect user
and match data from the Riot Games API, using a Flask backend, and
store this data in a MongoDB database. Additionally, it will provide
users with a React-based web application to view their own match history.
The project is being developed to help players of Riot Games' titles (e.g., League of Legends)
keep track of their in-game performance and match history.
